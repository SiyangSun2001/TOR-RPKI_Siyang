# TOR-RPKI_Siyang
This python simulator simultates the TORâ€™s relay selection process. The consensus file from Tor Metrics are used to simulate to network environment, including the relay status and bandwidth. Then, the simulator creates client object to mimic the relay selection process in actual TOR network. ROA/ROV coverage for guard relay and ROA-ROV matching connection coverage are extracted from these simulations. The flow diagram below shows the work flow of the python simulator in creating guard selection simulation, record ROA/ROV coverage etc.
